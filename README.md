# CS50-Projects-2022

#### This repository is a direct copy of all the work I completed for the CS50 Lab and Problem Set tasks for weeks 1 to 10. Course was completed in July/August 2022. These files were submitted and checked by CS50, however the CS50 gradebook and submission repository are private. With the exception of Tideman (91%), I received full marks for each of the tasks. The course was challenging, but fun. Learning to program in C also gave me a newfound appreciation for coding in Python and other high-level languages.
